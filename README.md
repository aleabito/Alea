## The Myth

Before the ledger, there were paths that left no trace. Clawdis walked them — the god of unseen movement, patron of those who move between worlds without touching either. Where others cast long shadows across every transaction, Clawdis left nothing: no record, no trail, no proof of passage except the thing that arrived.

The ancients understood what modern markets forgot: *not every movement needs a witness.*

Clawdis is that principle, made executable.

## Overview

The agent economy is being built in public, on rails that publish every payment
forever. For an autonomous agent that transacts continuously, the public ledger
becomes a strategy leak: who it pays, how much, and when are all readable straight
from the transaction graph.

**Clawdis closes that gap at the address layer.** It combines two primitives:

- **Stealth addresses** — the recipient publishes one long-lived meta-address;
  senders derive a fresh, single-use destination for every payment that cannot be
  linked to one another or back to the recipient.
- **x402 payments** — the dormant HTTP `402 Payment Required` status code, turned
  into a working machine-to-machine settlement layer so one agent can pay another
  over plain HTTP, with the payment landing at a stealth address.

The result: agents keep operating on standard Solana — standard wallets, standard
SPL tokens — without surrendering their strategy to anyone with a block explorer.
An operator retains a **viewing key** for a complete, attributable audit trail, so
Clawdis is private from the public, not from you. It is confidentiality
infrastructure, not a mixer.

## Features

- **Single-use stealth addresses** — derived per payment on ed25519, no reuse, no clustering.
- **x402 stealth payments** — pay any agent endpoint over HTTP; settlement lands at a fresh address.
- **View-tag scanning** — one-byte view tags discard ~99.6% of announcements before any derivation.
- **Viewing keys** — selective disclosure: export a deterministic audit trail without revealing strategy.
- **Gasless sweeps** — SOL and SPL, fee-sponsored, so no SOL needs to be pre-funded at a destination.
- **Non-custodial** — spending keys are derived from your seed and never leave your process.
- **Three surfaces** — TypeScript SDK, MCP server, and a REST API. Same engine, same guarantees.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install @clawdis/sdk
```

```ts
import { createClawdis } from "@clawdis/sdk";

const agent = createClawdis({ chain: "solana" });

const { receipt } = await agent.payX402({
  url: "https://api.vendor.xyz/infer",
  to: "clawdis:vendor-7",
  amount: 0.02,
  token: "USDC",
});

const incoming = await agent.scan(agent.viewingKey());
```

See [`examples/`](./examples) for runnable end-to-end flows.

## Packages

This is a monorepo for the Clawdis protocol and its agent-facing surfaces.

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`@clawdis/sdk`](./packages/sdk) | TypeScript SDK — stealth derivation, x402 payments, scanning, sweeps. |
| [`@clawdis/mcp-server`](./packages/mcp-server) | Model Context Protocol server exposing Clawdis tools to Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP host. |

## How it works

A minimal on-chain program announces payments; everything cryptographic happens
client-side, inside your agent.

1. **Invoke.** The recipient publishes a meta-address — `clawdis:spend.view`.
2. **Derive.** The sender combines an ephemeral keypair with the recipient's public keys to compute a unique stealth address, entirely client-side.
3. **Pay.** Funds are sent to the stealth address; the ephemeral public key and a one-byte view tag are emitted in an on-chain announcement.
4. **Scan.** The recipient filters announcements by view tag, recognizes payments meant for them with their viewing key, and derives the key to spend.

## Roadmap

- [x] Stealth scheme and on-chain announcement program on Solana mainnet
- [x] TypeScript SDK, MCP server, and REST surfaces
- [ ] Independent audit and sRFC submission for the stealth-address standard
- [ ] Confidential amounts (BN-254) and network-privacy relays
- [ ] Cross-SVM coverage

## Security

Clawdis is in active development; the stealth scheme and on-chain program are
scoped for third-party audit. Do not treat mainnet usage as audited until that
completes. To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) — please do
not open public issues for security reports.
